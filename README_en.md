We are iterating rapidly — please stay tuned for frequent updates! We are committed to rolling out a massive roadmap of new features and optimizations, with the ultimate goal of becoming the top-tier solution in the industry. Your feedback and feature requests are highly welcome!

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Method 1: Pull Pre-built Image (Easiest)

No need to clone the repository. Just download and run:

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturndec/waoowaoo/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturndec/waoowaoo/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env: generate a distinct random value for every blank secret. Keep
# MYSQL_PASSWORD in sync with DATABASE_URL and COMPOSE_DATABASE_URL (URL-encode special characters).
# Also configure a pre-created S3-compatible bucket reachable over public HTTPS.

# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```

> ⚠️ This is a beta version. Database is not compatible between versions. To upgrade, clear old data first:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker rmi ghcr.io/saturndec/waoowaoo:latest
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saturndec/waoowaoo/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

> After starting, please **clear your browser cache** and log in again to avoid issues caused by stale cache.

### Method 2: Clone & Docker Build (Full Control)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saturndec/waoowaoo.git
cd waoowaoo
cp .env.example .env
# Fill .env as described above; Compose refuses to start when required secrets are missing.
docker compose up -d
```

To update:
```bash
git pull
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Method 3: Local Development (For Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saturndec/waoowaoo.git
cd waoowaoo

# Copy environment config (must be done before npm install)
cp .env.example .env
# ⚠️ Configure database, Redis, external S3-compatible storage, authentication,
# encryption, and Bull Board. MYSQL_PASSWORD must match both database URLs.

npm install

# Start only the local database and queue. Media always uses the development S3 bucket in .env.
docker compose up mysql redis -d

# Push the Prisma schema
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

Visit [http://localhost:13000](http://localhost:13000) (Method 1 & 2) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (Method 3) to get started!

> Methods 1 and 2 initialize the database on first container launch; the external storage configuration and pre-created bucket are still required.

> [!WARNING]
> When running the app directly, do not skip `npm run db:push`. It synchronizes the Prisma schema before the application and workers start.
>
> Pre-create the object-storage bucket and grant the configured credentials permission to check
> the bucket and read, write, and delete objects. `S3_ENDPOINT` must be an HTTPS endpoint reachable
> by external AI providers. Local development uses a development bucket too, so no ngrok,
> cloudflared, local-file storage, or Docker MinIO is required. AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Tencent COS,
> and Alibaba OSS share the same `S3_*` configuration. GCS requires its XML API and HMAC credentials.
> Azure Blob does not implement S3 and is not directly supported.
>
> Before applying async Task/Assistant lifecycle migrations, stop new submissions and workers, then run `npm run db:async-migration-preflight`. Proceed only when active Tasks, the retired parent Task type, pending Outbox commands, and non-terminal Runs/Waits are all zero. The check is read-only and never backfills legacy Tasks.

> [!TIP]
> **If you experience lag**: HTTP mode may limit browser connections. Install [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) for HTTPS:
> ```bash
> caddy run --config Caddyfile
> ```
> Then visit [https://localhost:1443](https://localhost:1443)
